In this article, we'll introduce Private Domains for Temporary Email and how they help you to bypass common issues with registration and test email delivery.

This information will be useful to you if:

```markdown
- Your temporary email is not accepted at registration.
- You need a personal, nice-looking domain for your email.
- You need to test email delivery from a website or application (QA).

```

* Your temporary email is not accepted at registration.
* You need a personal, nice-looking domain for your email.
* You need to test email delivery from a website or application (QA).
