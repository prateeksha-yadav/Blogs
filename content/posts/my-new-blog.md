excerpt: >
  Every time, you want to create account on some forum or social media, like
  Facebook, you have to enter information about your e-mail box to get an
  activation link. Unfortunately, after registration, this social media sends
  you dozens of messages with useless information, which you are not interested
  in. As a rule, you register accounts in several social media, each of which
  has its advantages. For example, Facebook is more convenient for informal
  communication, LinkedIn – for professional communication and Instagram is used
  for media sharing.


  Even if this social media sends only 2-3 messages per day, your postbox will
  be littered with a hundred of useless messages by the end of a week. So, if
  you want to get rid of all this spam, you can use temporary mail when creating
  social media accounts.


  Many believe that the temporary mail is used solely by intruders for criminal
  purposes or spammers for sending ads and viruses. However, it is not.
  Temporary mail is an excellent tool for fighting spam. For example, you can
  use your real mailbox exclusively for personal or business communication, and
  temporary mailbox - for the rest of the correspondence and registration in
  social networks or various  forums. Thus, you won’t disclose your real mail,
  it won’t be littered, so you needn’t spend a lot of time sorting mail and
  searching for important email messages among spam.


  Disposable mail service is very simple to use and does not require
  registration. Just open the web page temp-mail.org in the browser on your
  computer or mobile device and you’ll get access to just generated temporary
  mailbox.


  Since the user does not enter any registration information to get access to
  the temporary mailbox, he protects himself from disclosing personal data.
  Thus, the user protects himself not only from unnecessary information messages
  from social networks, but also prevents possible attacks from intruders. At
  the present time, identity theft is quite common, therefore it is necessary to
  strive for maximum anonymity in the Internet, otherwise you risk losing your
  personal data from your devices and money from electronic purses or credit
  cards.


  Actively use temporary mail from temp-mail.org, and you will be protected as
  much as possible!
