In recent years, services offering disposable phone numbers for online verification have become increasingly popular. These assigned numbers can be used instead of real phone numbers, which means you can verify your online accounts while also avoiding the hassle of possible spam and unknown calls.

These numbers are also popular for quality assurance (QA) because they allow for testing SMS delivery around the world without the need to buy a SIM card in each country.

In this guide, we’ll detail how to use a temporary phone number to receive one-time password (OTP) verification code texts in order to register for online services including TikTok, Amazon and Netflix.

For a real-world example, we'll show how a temporary number can be used for verification when registering on Twitter.

What Is a Temporary Number?
Temporary number is a phone number on a real SIM card that is rented out over the Internet. Such numbers are typically purchased for text message verification purposes when registering for an online service.

How It Works
Purchase a temporary number for the selected country and service
Sign up with the service using the temporary phone number
The service will send a text message with a one-time code
Receive the text message and code in your browser or app
Input the code and complete your registration
The entire process typically takes no more than 5 minutes.

Advantages
●     Temporary numbers are cheap (from 10 cents per number)

●     You pay only for verification at the requested service

●     Numbers are backed up by real SIM cards

●     Available worldwide for multiple services

●     KYC identity verification not required

●     Issued numbers are always unique per person per service

To put it simply, if you only need a phone number to confirm your Twitter account, there is no point in buying a real or virtual SIM card. A temporary number works just as well.

Step-by-step instructions on how to use a temporary number service are detailed below.
